# Gentamicin
These documents are here to support clinicians in dosing gentamicin.  Gentamicin is a potent antibiotic, but needs to be handled with care to prevent adverse drug reactions.

Documents here are:
1. A poster I am presenting at a Gram-negative conference for the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy
2. The abstract behind this poster
3. An excel sheet which has the maths behind the nomograms
